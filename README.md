"C:\Users\sushm\Downloads\tableau.jpg"

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the electric vehicle (EV) market using Tableau. The dashboard includes key insights into the market size and growth of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs).

Key Highlights:

Total Vehicles: Comprehensive overview of EV market size and growth.

Average Electric Range: Technological advancements and efficiency analysis.

Total BEVs and PHEVs: Detailed breakdown and market share of BEVs and PHEVs.

Trends by Model Year: Visualization of EV growth and adoption trends since 2010.

Geographical Distribution: Map chart showing EV adoption across states.

Top Manufacturers and Models: Analysis of leading EV manufacturers and popular models.

CAFV Eligibility: Insights into the impact of Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives.

✅ Project Insights — Electric Vehicle Market Analysis (Tableau)

Analyzed over 150,000 electric vehicle records to uncover growth trends, regional adoption patterns, and brand dominance.

Identified that Tesla leads the market with 52.7% of total vehicle share, highlighting brand preference in the EV sector.

Discovered Washington State as the top contributor with 150,082 vehicles, showing concentrated regional adoption.

Found that Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) made up 77.6% of total sales, confirming strong consumer shift toward zero-emission models.

Revealed that 2023 had the highest spike in EV adoption with 37.1K vehicles — useful for forecasting future growth.

The dashboard enabled clear visualization of CAFV eligibility and model popularity, helping stakeholders target marketing and incentive strategies more effectively.
